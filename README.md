# Cereal Analysis

This is a repository for a for-fun side project where I weigh the cereal boxes at my house biweekly in order to better understand the patterns that underlie their consumption. Which cereals are eaten fastest? Slowest? Which are eaten together?

This will eventually become a Streamlit-powered dashboard website.
